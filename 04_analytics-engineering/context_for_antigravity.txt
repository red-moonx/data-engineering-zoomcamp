Context for Antigravity (AI Assistant)
========================================

Module: 04 - Analytics Engineering

Setup:
- The user is using dbt Cloud (not dbt Core / CLI)
- The data warehouse is BigQuery (not DuckDB)

Notes:
- Class notes in the class_notes/ folder may reference DuckDB and dbt Core setups.
- Many configuration steps (e.g., profiles.yml, connection setup) will differ for dbt Cloud + BigQuery.
- When helping the user, always account for the dbt Cloud + BigQuery context, even if the notes describe a different setup.
